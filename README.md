# CWRUBootcamp_M10_101122_Mission_To_Mars_Hoynacke
## Overview of Project 
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.
- Code is written that retrieves the full resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
- The full-resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary. 
- The titles for the hemisphere images are added to the dictionary. 
- The list contains the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image. 

Below outlines inmages retrieved and Screen Shots of the final code for that fullfills requirements for Deliverable 1:

## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using your Python and HTML skills, you’ll add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

Below are images showing the code that fullfills Devliverable 2
